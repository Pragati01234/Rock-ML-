# Rock-ML-
The data set was used by Gorman and Sejnowski in their study
of the classification of sonar signals using a neural network . The
project is to train a network to discriminate between sonar signals bounced
off a Mines and those bounced off a rock. Though the dataset is small but still it has approximately 60 features(attributes).This is a good project to start with, because

It is a classification problem, allowing you to practice with perhaps an easier type of supervised learning algorithm.
It is a multi-class classification problem (multi-nominal) that may require some specialized handling.
It only has 60 attributes and 207 rows, meaning it is small and easily fits into memory .
All of the numeric attributes are in the same units and the same scale, not requiring any special scaling or transforms to get started.
